# BlindMoov Project by Reazon-Team

### 1) What is BlindMoov ?

BlindMoov is a project designed by three students in electrical engineering, the project aims to help visually impaired people on a daily basis by offering them a pair of glasses that detect nearby obstacles and guide them in their movements. Equipped with three high-precision focal sensors, our sensors being connected to a sound device, the closer you get to the danger, the more the latter emits a warning signal quickly and strongly in order to prevent the source of danger.

the brand "BlindMoov" comes from "Blind" which means visually impaired / blind and "Moov" which is a term meaning movement, the name means concretely "Movement for the visually impaired".

Why BlindMoov? To put it simply, we realized that there are more than X Million French people with visual impairment (about XX%), and that they are more vulnerable when it comes to their own safety, we wanted to remedy this problem by creating products adapted to their needs, this is how BlindMoov was born.
